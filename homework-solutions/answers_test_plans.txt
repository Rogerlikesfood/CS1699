Requirements:

FUN-EVEN-ITER: Given an input value of an even positive integer, the iterator function shall return the input value divided by two (n / 2).

FUN-ODD-ITER: Given an input value of an even positive integer, the iterator function shall return the input value multiplied by three and adding one ( 3n + 1 ).

FUN-INVALID-NUM: Given an input value which is not a positive integer, the iterator function shall display "ERROR: INVALID NUMBER" and  raise an InvalidNumberException.


Test Plan:

IDENTIFIER: 1
TEST CASE: Check that the system will return n / 2 for the smallest valid even value of n, 2.
PRECONDITIONS: System is running and "> " prompt is displayed÷
INPUT VALUES: 2
EXECUTION STEPS: Enter "2" at the prompt and press enter.
OUTPUT VALUES: 1
POSTCONDITIONS: "1" is displayed on the screen.  System is running.

IDENTIFIER: 2
TEST CASE: Check that the system will return n / 2 for a large, even value of n, 9002.
PRECONDITIONS: System is running and "> " prompt is displayed÷
INPUT VALUES: 9002
EXECUTION STEPS: Enter "9002" at the prompt and press enter.
OUTPUT VALUES: 4501
POSTCONDITIONS: "4501" is displayed on the screen.  System is running.

IDENTIFIER: 3
TEST CASE: Check that the system will return 3n + 1 for the smallest odd valid value of n, 3.
PRECONDITIONS: System is running and "> " prompt is displayed÷
INPUT VALUES: 3
EXECUTION STEPS: Enter "3" at the prompt and press enter.
OUTPUT VALUES: 10
POSTCONDITIONS: "10" is displayed on the screen.  System is running.

IDENTIFIER: 4
TEST CASE: Check that the system will return 3n + 1 for a large odd valid value of n, 9001.
PRECONDITIONS: System is running and "> " prompt is displayed.
INPUT VALUES: 9001
EXECUTION STEPS: Enter "9001" at the prompt and press enter.
OUTPUT VALUES: 27004
POSTCONDITIONS: System is running.

IDENTIFIER: 5
TEST CASE: Check that the system will properly display an error message and exit if the invalid value of 0 is entered.
PRECONDITIONS: System is running and "> " prompt is displayed.
INPUT VALUES: 0
EXECUTION STEPS: Enter "0" at the prompt and press enter.
OUTPUT VALUES: None
POSTCONDITIONS: "ERROR: INVALID NUMBER" is displayed.  System is no longer running.

IDENTIFIER: 6
TEST CASE: Check that the system will properly display an error message and exit if the invalid value of -10 is entered.
PRECONDITIONS: System is running and "> " prompt is displayed.
INPUT VALUES: -10
EXECUTION STEPS: Enter "-10" at the prompt and press enter.
OUTPUT VALUES: None
POSTCONDITIONS: "ERROR: INVALID NUMBER" is displayed.  System is no longer running.

Traceability Matrix:

FUN-EVEN-ITER: 1, 2
