1.
[1 to 5 doughnuts] -> $0.50
[6 to 10 doughnuts] -> $0.40
[11 or more doughnuts] -> $0.35

2. 5, 6, 10, 11 are all explicit boundary values
   0, 1 is an implicit boundary between "no doughnuts" and "$0.50 doughnuts"
   MAXINT is an implicit boundary between valid values and the maximum of the system
   One may be able to argue that -1 and 0 are implicit boundaries between "valid" and "invalid" values (one can't buy negative doughnuts).


3. No, it is not a valid set of equivalence classes.  It is not *strictly partitioned* - the values of [100, 101, ... , 109, 110 MB] exist in multiple equivalence classes.

4. Grey - box testing.  The tester is using his or her knowledge of the codebase to develop black box tests.

5. White - box testing.  The tester is testing the code and its constituent parts directly.

6.
a. SUCCESS
b. FAILURE
c. FAILURE
d. SUCCESS

7.
a. BASE
b. EDGE
c. CORNER

8. Static testing does not cause code to execute (e.g. code reviews, code coverage analaysis, complexity analysis).  Dynamic testing does cause code to execute (e.g. unit testing, integration testing).
